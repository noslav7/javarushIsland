# javarushIsland
The project from Java Core section of Javarush course. It represents simulation of an island with animals and plants.

During each turn growth of plants, birth of animals and movement of the latter is happening.
Some animals also eat other animals and plants.
Statistics after each turn represent the results of all mentioned processes:
numbers of creatures of specific type in each cell, 
overall (general) animals count, number of animals, who changed their location during completed turn, animals, who eat etc.
The statistics is displayed in the console.

Overall island settings (height, width), number of turns, characteristics of creatures, their numbers, chances of a creature being spawn,
weigth, movement speed etc. could be set in .../resources/creature.yml file.
